- implement send as single-party, and broadcast or whatever as set-of-parties.
- utility functions for transposing located data structures.
- Maybe a way to have heterogenious inputs and outputs?
- A more type-safe way of expressing inputs and outputs.
- A more machine-efficient way of handling inputs and outputs.
- Better naming, _e.g._ for `locally`. 
- Add labels to (and change name of) `runClique`, so it can be used to annotate where in a program logged communication happens. 
- Pretty printing of general output.
- Lazy evaluation of infinite programs.
